## Sub-Task 1
You will find a folder, named as <i>Subtask-1</i> in the <b>main</b> branch of this repository. In that folder, you have to create a text file the  name of which will be your <b>Github Username</b>.  
In that text file, you have to answer the following things :
- Your Full Name
- Your Nick Name (or something, you would like to be known as)
- Your Hometown & Homestate üòÇ
- What are you most excited to learn in the APK Month?
- What all societies do you want to be a part of during your 4 years of college life?
- The Course you Hate the Most

You will find a sample text file in that folder for your reference. Once you have answered all these ‚ùì, you just have to save the file, and push it to the <b>main</b> branch.

Welcome Guys & Gals, to the branch <b>Subtask-2</b>. Here, you will be completing your Subtask-2.
